## 1. Introduction
Email remains a prevalent and continually expanding mode of communication globally, boasting an estimated 3.8 billion users who collectively dispatch 281 billion emails each day.

The widely used Gmail Smart Compose feature might be familiar to many, even if its utilization goes unnoticed. When composing an email, you may have observed Gmail suggesting relevant sentences seamlessly. This intuitive feature is none other than Gmail Smart Compose in action.

## 2. Business Problem
Our objective is to develop a model capable of predicting sentences or words based on the provided input sequence. This entails constructing a sequence-based model wherein the input comprises a series of words, and the anticipated output is likewise a sequence of words. This task aligns with the language modeling paradigm, specifically focusing on generating the next word, commonly referred to as a next-word prediction. The challenge at hand is to create an effective model that excels in understanding contextual patterns and accurately forecasts the subsequent words in a given sequence.
